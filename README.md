# Banking Software System README

## Overview
This repository contains the source code for a banking software system developed as part of an assessment task. The system is designed to provide a user-friendly interface and robust backend to handle various banking operations. It is built following Agile/XP programming principles and utilizing software engineering tools.

## Functionalities
The banking software system includes the following functionalities:

1. **Account Management**
   - Create and set up new banking accounts (Personal/Business).
   - Edit account details (e.g., user information, account type).
   - Close an account.

2. **Financial Transactions**
   - Deposit cash with receipt generation.
   - Withdraw cash with real-time balance update.
   - Transfer funds between different accounts within the same bank.
   - Implement transaction history with filters (date, type, amount).

3. **Account Services**
   - View detailed account information, including current balance, recent transactions, and account type.
   - Request and manage services like checkbooks and debit/credit cards.
   - Set up and manage recurring payments and direct debits.

4. **Security and Compliance**
   - Implement robust authentication mechanisms (e.g., two-factor authentication).
   - Ensure data encryption for sensitive information.
   - Comply with relevant financial regulations and data protection laws.

5. **Customer Support and Maintenance (optional)**
   - Integrated helpdesk for customer support.
   - Feature for reporting issues or fraudulent activities.

6. **Investment and Loan Services (optional)**
   - Interface for managing investments and stock market transactions.
   - Calculate and apply for personal and business loans.

7. **AI-Powered Financial Advice (optional)**
   - Implement AI algorithms to provide personalized financial advice based on user spending habits and savings goals.

## System Architecture
The system is designed with a layered architecture comprising:
- **Presentation Layer**: User interfaces for interaction 
- **Application Layer**: Business logic and workflow management.
- **Data Access Layer**: Interface to interact with the database.
- **Database**: Persistent storage for user data and transaction records.
